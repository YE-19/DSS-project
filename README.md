It is written in Markdown (.md) format, which is easily readable in environments like VS Code and GitHub. This document contains all the necessary instructions for project setup, execution, and clear guidance on the team's remaining implementation tasks.2. 🌟 Project OverviewThis project aims to implement the five classic approaches for Decision Making under Uncertainty using the Python programming language1. The primary goal is to build a flexible analytical tool that can handle any given Payoff Matrix for any business example2. The core structure is built using Classes in Python to ensure robust organization and flexibility. The project is being submitted to the Faculty of Business, Alexandria University, for the Decision Support System course in the 2025-2026 academic year3.3. ⚙️ Basic Setup and PrerequisitesTo ensure the code runs smoothly, every team member must have the following two prerequisites:Python 3.x: A functional installation of the Python interpreter.NumPy Library: The code heavily relies on the NumPy library for efficient matrix operations. To install it, open your VS Code Terminal or Command Prompt and run the following command: pip install numpy.4. 🚀 Project Execution Guide (Interactive Mode)The project is designed to run in an Interactive Mode via the command line.A. Running the ScriptNavigate to the folder containing decision_maker.py in your Terminal.Execute the script using the command: python decision_maker.py.B. Execution StagesMatrix Input Stage: The program will first prompt you to enter the Payoff Matrix. Enter the values for each Alternative (row) separated by spaces (e.g., 3000 1500 -500). When all Alternatives have been entered, type done to proceed.Method Selection Stage: You will then see a menu listing the seven available options (Maximax, Maximin, Hurwicz, etc.). Enter the corresponding number (e.g., 3 for Hurwicz). If you choose Hurwicz (3), you will be asked to input the Alpha ($\alpha$) value (between 0 and 1).5. 🧠 Code Structure and Remaining TasksThe foundation of the code, including the DecisionMaker Class and the interactive interface, is complete. Your team's sole focus must now be on programming the computational logic inside the five placeholder methods.
